Understanding Bug Hunter Bounties
-------------------------------

**How bug bounties work**: To participate in a bug bounty program, aspiring bug hunters must first find a vulnerability in the target software or system. Once a vulnerability is discovered, the researcher must responsibly disclose it to the affected company, following the established guidelines for reporting issues. Rewards are then distributed based on the severity of the vulnerability and other factors specified by the program's rules.

By exploring various bug bounty programs and mastering the art of finding 0-day vulnerabilities, ethical hackers can make a significant impact on cybersecurity while earning recognition and financial compensation for their efforts.
