When learning a dance from YouTube videos, we often look for a mirrored video that has been horizontally flipped. However, even if the video itself is not flipped, there is a way to flip the videos automatically and easily on desktop devices. You can also slow down the speed of the video.

First of all, download <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dance-practice-toolkit-fo/odmglmjpojlhploiiaemcdohkeoapakf" target="_blank">a free browser extension called <b>Mirror YouTube 4 Dance Practice</b></a>. You can install it by clicking on the "Add to Chrome" button in the screenshot above. This app does not collect your browser history nor your private information. And it's 100% free!

It's very easy to use. As the video above suggests, you can first click on the extension icon on the right side of the address bar on your browser. Then you can simply turn on the switch or change the tempo value to change the video. The settings for each video are automatically remembered, so it's always there even when you refresh the page.

Hope you find this useful and have fun dancing! Thank you.
